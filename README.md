# Spark-Foundation-Data_Analytics
Task_1: In this task we do predict the percentage of marks of student based on study hours
I used Linear Regression
it has some failure point.Make it better 
Ex. for more than 20 hours output percentage is greater than 100% both are absurd.
Work is done on google colab
 
Task_2:In this task accuracy is poor,any suggestion or help will be appreciated
